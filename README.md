<h1 align="center">Bixi 2020 Analysis</h1>
<p align="center"><i>A personal project to train on Python and Pandas.</i></p>
This was initially a project I had in mind for my Le Wagon project week (but worked on another awesome project instead).

I really like Bixi sharing system :bike: and appreciate that they put in <a href="https://bixi.com/en/page-27">open data a lot of information</a>.

I have limited my work on the year 2020. This project is available as a Jupyter Notebook.

<h3 align="center">To visualize the notebook fully (including displayed maps), please use <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/srasetti/bixi/blob/main/Bixi.html">the preview tool</a>.</h3>
